# Arctic Scroll, A Read Me

A simple but more useful internal link scroller with options. Code by [@pauladamdavis](http://twitter.com/pauladamdavis)

## Todo

* Add easing
* Check & test horizontal scrolling
* Allow constant speed of scrolling, so further element take longer to get to but doesn't kill performance.
